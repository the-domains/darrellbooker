# Why I'm using Apple Maps Again

2 Reasons:

The blue 'Touch Here To Return To Navigation' bar that stays at the top of your screen when you leave maps makes multitasking between other apps very useful.

Live navigation on the lock screen is perfect for when your phone auto locks. No need to unlock it to continue seeing directions.

Don't get me wrong I still use Google Maps to look up businesses and for street view but Apple Maps is definitely making headway.
