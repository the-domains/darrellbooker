            <description><![CDATA[<p>First off, I think this process should be a lot more straightforward than it is and make more use of GUI’s but this is Microsoft we are talking about here. So after you add a Bulk Insert Task to your SSIS package and specify the flat file to import you must specify a format file to use. Personally, I think it would make everyone’s life easier if it just popped up a Edit Mappings option similar to using the Import Data feature in SQL Server. Instead you have to generate a format file that controls the mapping. You can pop open Notepad and create it by hand but of course you’ll probably get something wrong. Instead take a trip back to the early 90’s and start a dos command to run the BCP(Bulk Copy Program) utility. Type the following in DOS BCP database.dbo.tablename format nul -f FORMATNAME.FMT -c -SServerName -UUserName -PPassword Substituting database, tablename, FORMATNAME.FMT, ServerName, UserName, and Password with your information. ***Very important*** By default the file will use “\t” to indicate the fields in your source file is tab delimited. If your file is comma delimited change those to “,”. Once done I must admit you end up with a nicely formatted format (.fmt) file to specify in SSIS. Leave it to Microsoft to make something that should take 5 minutes into a 20-30 minute process. enjoy!</p>]]></description>
